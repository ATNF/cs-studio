Implementation of the PV interface for ChannelAccess.
<p>
Uses internal reference counting.
When one requests the same PV more than once
from the pure java CA client library, one
always receives the same channel instance.
<p>
When several plug-ins use CA, it is on one hand
desired that they use the same CA client library context,
but the above feature means that they receive
the same channel reference without knowing.
<p>
This makes it impossible to write proper cleanup code:
If the channel is left open, resources are wasted,
also on the IOC. If it is closed, one might accidentally
close a channel that is still used by another plugin.
<p>
If all plugins go through this PV interface,
the PV interface will perform the reference counting
for the one and only channel that is obtained
from the CA client libraries.
