<h2>Data Browser Config View</h2>
Most of the configuration is adjusted in this view,
accessible via the context menu of the plot window.
<br>
It has two sub-sections or "tabs".

<h3>"Process Variables" Tab</h3>
This subsection configures which PVs are shown in the plot and how.
You can add PVs by entering their name in the
"&lt;Add PV&gt;" cell of the "Process Variables" table.
To delete PVs, select them and then use the context menu of the PV table.
<p>
You can change the axis assigment, color, and line width of each PV.
For the the axis assignments, the number in the "Axis" column identifies
the Y-Axes via numbers 0, 1, 2, ...
So to put PVs on the same, first axis, enter "0".
To place them on two axes, enter "0" or "1" for the respective PV.
<p>
The "Min" and "Max" settings determine the Y-Axis range. The "Type" selects
a linear or log. axis. Since these settings modify the Y-Axis, they percolate
to all PVs on that axis.

<h4>Archive Table</h4>
This table lists the archive data sources which are used to read samples
for the selected PV.
<p>
To add archive data sources, Drag-and-Drop from the
<a href=archive_view.html>Archive View</a>
onto a PV. You can drop them onto the Plot Window,
which adds the source to all PVs in the plot,
or onto a selected PV in the config view.
Then, you can rearrange the order of 
archives for a PV via the context menu
of the "Archives used for ..." table.

<h3>"Live Data Config" Tab</h3>
This subsection configures how often 'live'
data samples are taken for the PVs,
and how often the plot redraws.
For example, one can sample a PV every 2 seconds, and redraw
every 4 seconds.
Note that redraws are quite costly in terms of CPU usage, so
reducing the redraw rate by increasing the update period can
help to reduce the CPU load.
