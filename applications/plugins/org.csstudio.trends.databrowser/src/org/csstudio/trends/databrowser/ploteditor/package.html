The 'Plot' is the main user interface of the data browser.
<p>
It displays the data in a plot, so it's probably what the user
views most, while other 'views' allow configuration of colors
etc.
<p>
So one would probably consider this plot a 'view', while the
other windows actually 'edit' the data browser model.
But in the Eclipse environment, an 'editor' is used for the plot,
because that way we can associate a plot with a config file, and have more than
one plot open. You can open and close the config windows, but when trying
to close the plot window for a modified configuration, Eclipse prompts
with a "Do you want to save?" dialog.
<p>
The windows used to change colors, remove channels,
configure archive etc. could be considered 'editors',
because they modify the configuration of the data browser.
But since they don't actually hold the configuration,
only provide a 'view with write access' to the configuration
in the plot editor, they are eclipse 'views'.
