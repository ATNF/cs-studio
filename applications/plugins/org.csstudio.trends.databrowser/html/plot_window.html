<h2>Data Browser Plot Window</h2>

The Plot window could be considered the "main" window of the Data Browser.
Its title bar displays the name of the associated configuration file,
or "&lt;not saved&gt;" for a newly created Data Browser instance
that is not (yet) saved to a configuration file.

<h3>Zoom/Pan Button Bar</h3>
The button bar on top of the plot window provides interactive pan and zoom
operations.
In case the button bar is not visible, use the plot's context menu to
re-enable it.
<ul>
<li>"Up/Down", <img src=../icons/up.gif>/<img src=../icons/down.gif>:<br>
    Move the chart up respectively down.
    If the plot has multiple Y-Axes, you can move all axes or only a selected
    Y-Axis. See next section on details of Y-Axis selection.
<li>"Y-In/Out", <img src=../icons/y_in.gif>/<img src=../icons/y_out.gif>:<br>
    Zooms the selected or all Y-Axes in respectively out.
<li>"Auto-Zoom", <img src=../icons/autozoom.gif>:<br>
    Zooms all or the selected Y-Axis to display the channel data of
    the current X-Axis time range.
<li>"Stagger", <img src=../icons/stagger.gif>:<br>
    If there is only a single Y-Axis, this is the same as Auto-Zoom.
    For multiple Y-Axes, all Y-Axes are zoomed such that they optimally show
    their current samples without overlapping.
    <br>
    For 2 Axes, one will auto-zoom to fill the upper half of the plot,
    and the other axis data will occupy the lower half of the plot.
<li>"Default Zoom", <img src=../icons/defaultscale.gif>:<br>
    Uses the axis limits suggested by the PV. In case none are available,
    defaults to auto-zoom.
<li>"Left/Right", <img src=../icons/left.gif>/<img src=../icons/right.gif>:<br> 
    Moves the chart left/right. 
<li>"X-In/Out", <img src=../icons/x_in.gif> / <img src=../icons/x_out.gif>:<br>
    Zooms the X or "time" axis in/out.
<li>"Scroll On/Off", <img src=../icons/scroll_on.gif>/<img src=../icons/scroll_off.gif>:<br>
    Turns scrolling on resp. off. When "on", the plot will continually scroll
    in strip-chart fashion such that the right edge reflects the current time.
    <p>
    The scroll speed is configured in the
    <a href=config_view.html>Config View</a>.
    <p>
    Scrolling is automatically disabled in response to manual X-Axis
    zoom and pan operations, since scrolling would otherwise interfere with
    your manual X-Axis adjustments.
<li>"More", ...:<br>
    Opens a dialog box for entering custom start and end times, i.e. X-Axis
    limits.
</ul>

<h3>Selecting a Y Axis</h3>
If a plot has multiple Y-Axes, most of the Zoom and Pan operations described
above can operate on all axes or only a selected Y-Axis.
To select a Y-Axis, simply click onto the Y Axis.
The axis will redraw in a slightly wider line width,
and grid lines in the plot further emphasize the selected axis.
<p>
To de-select a Y-Axis, click on the X-Axis or just outside the
actual plot region and Y-axes area.

<h3>'Rubberband' Zoom</h3>
You can zoom into the plot by 'rubberbanding' a rectangle:
Click at start point, drag rectangle, release, and the plot will zoom
into the selected region.

<h3>Sample Markers</h3>
When clicking into the plot window, a marker is placed next to the nearest
sample, displaying the channel name, value and other information about the
sample. You can place multiple markers.
<p>
To remove markers, use the plot's context menu.

<h3>'Drop' PVs</h3>
You can use Drag-and-Drop to add PVs to the plot by dropping PVs
into the plot region itself, or onto a Y-Axis.
When dropping onto the Plot, the new PV is added with its own new Y-Axis.
When dropping onto an existing Y-Axis, the PV is added to that Y-Axis.

<h3>Context Menu Options</h3>
The context menu has the following options:
<ul>
<li>Show/Hide Button Bar: Toggles the button bar on or off.
<li>Remove all Markers: Removes all sample markers.
<li>Remove selected Markers: Removes the selected sample markers. Select them by clicking on them.
<li>Add PV: Opens dialog box for entering new PV name.
<li>Config View: Opens the <a href=config_view.html>Config View</a>.
<li>Archive View: Opens the <a href=archive_view.html>Archive View</a>.
<li>Sample View: Opens the <a href=sample_view.html>Sample View</a>.
<li>Export View: Opens the <a href=export_view.html>Export View</a>.
<li>Open As View: Opens the currently saved data browser configuration file
    as a read-only 'View'.
<li>Data Browser Perspective: Selects the <a href=setup.html>Data Browser Perspective</a>.
</ul>
