# Default RDB archive settings.
# plugin_preferences.ini can override
# @author Kay Kasemir

# RDB URL for archived data
# If your site uses the same settings everywhere, you
# can specify them here.
# If you switch between production and test setups, better set these
#  preferences in the
#   plugin_customization.ini
# of the ArchiveEngine etc., or use the command-line
# arguments of the products.
#
# Oracle example
# url=jdbc:oracle:thin:user/password@//172.31.73.122:1521/prod
#
# MySQL example
url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/archive

# RDB user and password
# Some applications also provide command-line option to override.
user=archive
password=$archive

# Schema name. Used with an added "." as prefix for table names.
# For now this is only used with Oracle URLs and ignored for MySQL
schema=CHAN_ARCH.
