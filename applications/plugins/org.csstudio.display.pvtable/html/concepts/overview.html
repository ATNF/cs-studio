<h1>Overview</h1>
This is far from done!
It is my playground for trying things while reading the
"eclipse - Building Commercial-Quality Plug-ins" book. 
<p>
<h3>Basic Idea</h3>
The PV Table provides a tabular view of PV names and their current value.
One can start and stop live value updates.
<p>
In addition, one can take a "snapshot" of current values, which gets saved
when saving the PV table document.
The PV table display indicates current values that differ from the "snapshot"
values in red.
<p>
One can configure the update rate as well as the threshold for indicating
differences between the current values and those from the snapshot.</body>
