    <h2>Welcome to CSS!</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CSS means <b>C</b>ontrol <b>S</b>ystem <b>S</b>tudio. It is a software, 
    which is intended to be used in environments, where an operator has to 
    visualize data with synoptic displays. It provides configurable synoptic 
    displays for various data-sources.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>historical Background</h3>
    <p>In 2005, Mr. Matthias Clausen from the DESY institute (Hamburg) had the 
    idea to build a new controlling software system, based on the existing 
    EPICS-Software. The EPICS-software (current state 02/2006) is a MUD-System (Multi-User-Developed 
    System) with tons of synoptic displays in different graphical designs. Also, 
    the navigation and the Look-and-Feel of the existing system is different in 
    each extension.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The new Software shall provide</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a unique Look-and-Feel</li>
      <li>a unique navigation</li>
      <li>an architecture which is simple to extend</li>
      <li>configurable display settings</li>
      <li>Record-and-Playback-mechanism.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>technical approach</h3>
    <p>We decided to implement the new CSS Software with Eclipse. The 
    Plugin-Architecture makes it relatively easy to extend the system with own 
    features and functions. Due to the fact, that not all developers are firm 
    in developing plugins for eclipse, we will provide a lot of wizards, that 
    will help them to develop own plugins, without the knowledge of 
    administrative tasks.</p>
