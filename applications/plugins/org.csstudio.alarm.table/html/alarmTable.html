<h2>JMS Alarm Table</h2>
<p>The plugin "JMS Logs" shows the current respectively the archived log-messages,
tabularly. It gets the new messages from the JMS-Server and produces an update for
every new message. One can ask for archived messages in a defined period of time.
The messages are all of the type "MapMessage" which consist of an attribute and a
corresponding value. An attribute of a "MapMessage" corresponds to a  table column.</p>
<p>To show the log-messages one can use three different Views:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span
		style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"
		lang="DE">JMS Log viewer: All received log-messages are in the table. The 
		newest message is inserted in the first line of the table.</span></li>
	<li><span
		style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">
		JMS Alarm viewer: The table shows message of type "ALARM" only. The first
		sort key is the value of attribute "SEVERITY", the second is the time the
		message was received.</span></li>
	<li><span
		style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"
		lang="DE">JMS Log archive viewer: With this view you get the log-messages
		from the database. The buttons on top of the windows are for predefined - 
		or user defined time periods.</span></li>
</ul>
