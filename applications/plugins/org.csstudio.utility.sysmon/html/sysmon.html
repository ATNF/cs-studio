<h1>CSS System Monitor</h1>

A simple system monitor for tracking memory usage.
<p>
The displayed "max", "total" and "free" memory is obtained from the Java
<b>Runtime</b> API, and its meaning is not immediately obvious:
<ul>
<li>"Max" Memory:<br>
    The maximum amount of memory that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will
    ever attempt to use. It is an upper bound that prevents the JVM from using
    all of the computer's memory.
<li>"Total":<br>
    The amount of memory that the JVM currently uses for objects in-use as well
    as new objects. So this includes what most people would call "available"
    memory, i.e. memory that the JVM has reserved for new objects but doesn't
    currently use.
<li>"Free":<br>
    Memory that the JVM considers "free".
</ul>

One guess of the author is that one can consider "max - total + free" the
actual "available" memory, but the behavior of the JVM's garbage collection
is very unpredictable: It will sometimes hold on to memory that was freed
after closing some part of the application, while at other times such
memory shows up as "free" right away.

<h2>Setup</h2>
All the settings are adjusted via the System Monitor preference page.
