This library serves two purposes:
For one, it simply offers a PV interface
for EPICS ChannelAccess that I found
very convenient.
<p>
It actually 'connects' in several steps:
<ol>
<li>First, it obviously tries to connect to a channel.
<li>When that suceeds, and we thus know the native type etc. of the channel,
    it requests meta information (units, precision, ...).
<li>When receiving that, it subscribes to updates of timestamp/value/status
<li>When receiving the first subscription update, we declare the PV
    fully 'connected'.
</ol>
Consequently, users of this API get the full value and meta information
without having to worry about details.
<p>
In addition, it uses internal reference counting.
When one requests the same PV more than once
from the pure java CA client library, one
always receives the same channel instance.
<p>
When several plug-ins use CA, it is on one hand
desired that they use the same CA client library context,
but the above feature means that they receive
the same channel reference without knowing.
<p>
This makes it impossible to write proper cleanup code:
If the channel is left open, resources are wasted,
also on the IOC. If it is closed, one might accidentally
close a channel that is still used by another plugin.
<p>
If all plugins go through this PV interface,
the PV interface will perform the reference counting
for the one and only channel that is obtained
from the CA client libraries.

<address>
The 'raw' access to CA should be replaced by DAL.
The reference counting aspect of this package should then
become obsolete. Unclear if certain apps then still prefer
this 'PV' interface, or directly use DAL.
