# RDB URL for archived data
# If your site uses the same settings everywhere, you
# can specify them here.
# But in most cases one might need to switch between production
# and test setups, and then it might be better to instead add them
# to the
#   plugin_customization.ini
# of the ArchiveEngine etc., or use the command-line
# arguments of the eng product.

#url=jdbc:oracle:thin:user/password@//172.31.73.122:1521/prod
#url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/archive?user=fred&password=$fred

# Schema name. Used with an added "." as prefix for table names.
# For now this is only actually used with Oracle URLs
# and ignored for MySQL
schema=chan_arch

# When user and password are specified here,
# they're used. Otherwise they have to be in the URL.
# Putting them here somewhat hides them from the end user
#user=archive
