<h2>Data Browser Preferences</h2>
Preferences are configured via the menu
<pre>CSS/Preferences</pre>, then navigating
to <pre>CSS Applications/Trends/Data Browser.</pre>

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Default to Autoscale for new PV</h3>
Should newly added PVs use "auto scale"?

<h3>Show Request Types</h3>
Preferably, the Data Browser Plot will
request data optimized for plotting,
and automatically display raw samples
when you zoomed in far enough.
<p>
But if you prefer to eat up memory for
no good reason and crash the application,
you have the option of user-selectable
request types, including raw samples.

<h3>Plot Bins</h3>
Number of optimized samples that the Data Browser
requests. A value like 200 should give a good
compromize: You see what the data looks like
(min, max, averate) without requiring too much
memory and network traffic.

<h3>Default Start/End Time</h3>
Start and end times used for new plots.

<h3>Archive Server URLs</h3>
Default archive server URLs shown in the 
<a href=archive_view.html>Archive View</a>.

<h3>Default Archives for new PVs</h3>
Default archive server URLs and keys used
for new PVs.
In the Data Browser Editor, you can of course
change those or add new ones from the
<a href=archive_view.html>Archive View</a>.
