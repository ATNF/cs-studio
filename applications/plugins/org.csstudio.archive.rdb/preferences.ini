# Default RDB archive settings.

# RDB URL for archived data
# If your site uses the same settings everywhere, you
# can specify them here.
# If you switch between production and test setups, better set these
#  preferences in the
#   plugin_customization.ini
# of the ArchiveEngine etc., or use the command-line
# arguments of the products.
#
# Oracle example
#url=jdbc:oracle:thin:user/password@//172.31.73.122:1521/prod
#
# MySQL example
#url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/archive?user=fred&password=$fred
#
# Holy mother cracker!
# SNS cluster, load-balanced on the server(!) side 
url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS_LIST=(LOAD_BALANCE=OFF)(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=172.31.75.138)(PORT=1521))(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=172.31.75.141)(PORT=1521)))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=ics_prod_lba)))

# RDB user and password if they're not already in the URL.
# Putting them here somewhat hides them from the end user,
# because the URL may be displayed in several places.
# Some applications also provide command-line option to override.
#user=archive
#password=$archive

# Schema name. Used with an added "." as prefix for table names.
# For now this is only used with Oracle URLs and ignored for MySQL
schema=chan_arch

# Maximum length of text samples written to SAMPLE.STR_VAL
max_text_sample_length=80

# Minimum sample period.
# Must be > 0 to avoid div-0 error.
# Also enforces some sampling sanity.
min_sample_period=0.1

# Timeout in seconds used for some SQL operations
# This is a suggestion to the JDBC calls.
# With Oracle, it doesn't appear to be very exact.
# Default: 30 min
sql_timeout=1800
