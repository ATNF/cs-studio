    by tying this inside Matlab:<br>
    <pre>matlabroot</pre>
<li>Create a subdirectory 'arch' in there, and move the files in this package
    into that directory.
<li>Either type the following each time you start matlab,
    or add it to the matlab startup.m file:
    <pre>
	javaaddpath(fullfile(matlabroot, 'arch', 'channelarchiver.jar'))
	addpath(fullfile(matlabroot, 'arch'))
    </pre>
    <p>
    Search the Matlab online help for 'startup.m' in case you
    want this to happen automatically on startup.
