# Timeout [seconds] for certain SQL queries
# Fundamentally, the SQL queries for data take as long as they take
# and any artificial timeout just breaks queries that would otherwise
# have returned OK  few seconds after the timeout.
# We've seen Oracle lockups, though, that caused JDBC to hang forever
# because the SAMPLE table was locked. No error/exception, just hanging.
# A timeout is used for operations other than getting the actual data,
# for example the channel id-by-name query which _should_ return within
# a shot time, to catch that type of RDB lockup.
