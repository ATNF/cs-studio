<h2>OPI Runtime</h2>

<p>OPI Runtime is responsible for executing and managing OPI files. By default, you can run an .opi file by double-clicking on it in the Navigator. 
If it's not opened in runtime, you can still open an .opi file with OPI Runtime by right clicking the file and choose Open With->OPI Runtime. 
</p>

<p>OPI Runtime works like a modern web browser. It arrange OPIs in Tabs. Each tab can be rearranged by dragging it to a new place or new window.
By default, <code>Open OPI</code> action will replace the current OPI with the new OPI. 
But <code>Ctrl-Cliking</code> a widget with <code>Open OPI</code> action attached will open the OPI in a new Tab. Or in a new window by <code>Shift-Cliking</code>

If the current OPI is replace with new OPI, you can still go back or go forward from Navigation buttons on toolbar.

You can also zoom in/out from toolbar or by <code>Ctrl-Scrolling</code>.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to standalone control system display managers, BOY is integrated in CSS, meaning:
You can open a context menu on any widget in a BOY display and send the PV that is displayed
by the widget to other CSS tools. For example, you can send the PV to the Data Browser to see
a strip-chart of the PV's value over time.
</p>

<p>If you have Elog or Email plugin installed, you will be able to send the OPI screen shot to 
Elog or an Email address.</p>

<p>Compact Mode will have menu bar and toolbar hidden. You can always exit compact mode by selecting
"Exit Compact Mode". Similar to Full Screen Mode.</p>

<h4>Top OPIs</h4>
<p>There is a <code>Top OPIs</code> drop-down button on toolbar, on which you can define which OPIs to open from preference page. This is very useful for a site if you have 
a "map" opi. In BOY, you can use URL path at everywhere if a path is needed. For example, if you set
a URL path <code>http://www.xxx.com/main.opi</code> for the top OPIs in preference page, you will be able
to run this OPI directly from Top OPIs button.</p>
