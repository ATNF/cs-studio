Time stamp gymnastics.
<p>
The time parser code heavily borrows from Sergei Chevtsov's implementations
for the original Java Archive Viewer.
<p>
The main difference to end users:
Dates are in YYYY/MM/DD order, a format that's sometimes
called the "scientific" form, since it makes it easier to sort dates.
Internally, the code has been split into pieces, and unit tests were added.
<p>
In addition, it is now possible to provide "3 month 10 minutes" instead of just
"3M 10m", which is easier to remember than the original requirements for
upper vs. lower case.
<p>
For usage, start reading at the StartEndTimeParser class.
