<h1>Features</h1>

Things to try:
<ul>
<li>When loaded, there should be a new view "CSS/PV Table", as
    well as an editor for the file "lib/excas.xml".
    I'm trying to keep view and editor similar,
    since I don't know which one's more suitable for this task.    
<li>Per default, the view displays some PVs from the 'excas' example server
    that comes with EPICS base (same with the excas.xml).
<li>Table columns auto-resize to fill the view.
<li>One can start/stop PV updates, and add/cut/copy/paste PVs by various means
<li>One can drag PV names to/from for example MS Word.
    Doesn't seem to work with Mac OSX "terminal" window.  
<li>Table allows changing the 'readback' PV   
<li>One can only have a PV once per view or editor,
    but in multiple editors.
<li>Editor has simple outline support.
<li>Take snapshot of value as "saved" value.
<li>Configurable "tolerance", and all "current" values that differ
    from "saved" value by more than the tolerance show up red.
<li>Load/save the config from lib/excas.xml.
<li>File/New Other CSS PVTable support.
</ul>
