<h1>Archive Access API</h1>

org.csstudio.archive.channelarchiver is an implementation
for the ChannelArchiver's network data server,
currently used by the data browser app to test the 
feasability of the API, and to make some (slow) progress
with the data browser.

<address>
The ultimate goal is to eventually agree on details for the interfaces/abstracts in
org.csstudio.archive, then pull that into a 'css-core' plugin,
while the specific implementations for the Channel Archiver's network data server,
the DESY AAPI etc. become separate.
<p>
So this package should be temporary.
