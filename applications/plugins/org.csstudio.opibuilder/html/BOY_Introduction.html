    <h2>
      Best OPI, Yet (BOY)
    </h2>
    <p>
      The CSS BOY is an Operator Interface (OPI) development and runtime environment. An OPI is a graphical user
      interface which can display the control system live data graphically and provides the interface to input data to
      control system.

    <p>
      With BOY, one can develop a powerful OPI in few minutes and start to run it immediately. On one hand, it has the
      simple idea to connect and read/write a PV: specify the PV name of a widget and then you can run to see or set the
      value of the PV. On the other hand, each widget can attach more than one JavaScript to it, in which one can write
      simple code to change the widget properties dynamically or implement very complicated algorithm.
      <p>
        The OPI Editor in BOY is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. It has most of the modern editing
        features which facilitate the OPI editing greately, such as copy, paste, undo, redo, arrange multiple widgets,
        snap to grid or other widgets(geometry), ruler, guide, zoom in/out, change order, create group and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The OPI Runtime can display the OPIs either in tabs or windows. It also provides the navigation function as in a
        modern web browser, by which one can easily navigate from the opened OPIs history.
