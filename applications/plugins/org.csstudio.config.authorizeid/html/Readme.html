<h1>AuthorizeId</h1>

Authorize Id is a plugin for CSS, which works with LDAP entries that are in group EpicsAuthorizeID. 
It can display entries, create new, edit and delete them. Entries in first table are names, entries 
in second table are attributes of that name. If name is edited or deleted,  all attributes are 
automatically edited or deleted too.

<h3>If entry name is not valid?</h3>
Plugin will automatically forbid user to enter a name which is invalid, for example if name is empty
or has LDAP non-supported characters.

<h3>Tips and tricks</h3>
To find a field name or attributes quickly, just type it and it will automatically go to a row with 
that field name. You can also click on column header to sort the names or attributes alphabetically.
