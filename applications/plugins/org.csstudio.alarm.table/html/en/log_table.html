<h1>Dynamisation of properties</h1>
<p align="justify">Properties that are dynamic are marked with a rack-wheel (
<img src="./../image/SDS_DynamicSymbol.png" />
). To edit the dynamic behaviour of a widget property right click on the
appropriate one in the property view and select 'Configure Dynamic
Aspects'.</p>

<br>
<p align="justify">The simplest way of dynamisation is to show the current value of a
process variable in the display. The Rule is 'Direct Connection' (see
the example in the screenshot).

<br>
<br>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p align="justify">In the top part of the Window 'Dynamics Wizard' is a list of all
available rules. There are two kinds of rules. The 'Java Rules' marked
with
<img src="./../image/SDS_IconJavaRule.png" />
are implemented as a java class. They are integrated in SDS and it is
necessary to edit the source code of the plugins to add new rules. The
'ECMS Script Rule' or 'Java Script Rule' marked with
<img src="./../image/SDS_IconScriptRule.png" />
are located in the CSS workspace in the folder 'SDS Script Rules'. To
add a new rule you have to store the java script file in the folder and
it is available for the properties.</p>
<h3>Rule Filter</h3>
<p align="justify">The selection of rules in the list depends on the type of property. The
return type of the rule has to match the property type. In the first
line of the rule the return type is set. It is possible to use all Java
types as return types.</p>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<p align="justify">The lower section holds the list of input and output channels that the
rule defines. In the value field you can use the alias names that are
defined in the widget or display instead of the process variable name.
It is marked by the symbol '$' at the beginning and end of the String.</p>
