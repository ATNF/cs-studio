<h1>Scan Support</h1>

<h2>Idea</h2>

<p>The org.csstudio.scan plugins provide a scan system
inspired by the "ScanEngine" developed by the
APS Software Services Group (SSG).
</p>

<p>A Scan Server can execute a sequence of scan commands.
Several scan configurations can be submitted to the server.
Ongoing scans can be monitored, paused, resumed, aborted.
</p>

<h2>Example Setup</h2>

<h3>Prepare</h3>

<ul>
<li>Start with IDE that can run SNS CSS.</li>
<li>Add PyDev to the IDE.</li>
<li>Locate the org.csstudio.scan/examples folder.</li>
<li>In the scan_client.py file, edit the path setup section found at the start of the file.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Run Demo IOC</h3>

<ul>
<li>Run EPICS softIoc for examples/simulation.db</li>
</ul>

<h3>Run Scan Server</h3>

<p>Run or export the org.csstudio.scan.server/ScanServer.product.
</p>

<p>The ScanServer product can be run with command-line option
<pre> 
   -console
</pre> 
or
<pre> 
   -console 4884
</pre> 
for the (network) console. Type "help" in the console to see ScanServer commands.
</p>

<p>If the ScanServer is run on a different host, make sure that its ports are
accessible via the firewall.
Defaults are in ScanServer.java.
Use /etc/sysconfig/iptables to enable port 4810, 4811.
</p>

<p>To access such a remote ScanServer, run clients with 
<pre>
  -DScanServerHost=...
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Run CSS with GUI</h3>

<p>Add the org.csstudio.scan.ui.feature to the CSS product,
which includes the scan monitor as well as PyDev.
</p>

<p>Configure the product as follows after its initial start:
</p>

<ul>
<li>In CSS, create a "linked folder" for /examples so you can open the *.opi files
    and example scripts.
</li>
<li>To enable full PyDev use, open Edit/Preferences, PyDev.</li>
<li>Under "Interactive Console", increase the 
    "Maximum connection attempts for initial communication"
    from its default of 50 to 200.
</li>
<li>Configure "Interactive Console", adding the following to the
    "Initial interpreter commands":
<pre>
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/org.csstudio.scan/examples')
from scan_client import *
</pre>
</li>
<li>Configure "Interpreter - Jython".
    Ideally, point it to a jython.jar of a full jython setup,
    i.e. one that includes a Lib/ subdirectory
    with standard library sources.
    As a minimal alternative, configure it to use the jython.jar
    in org.csstudio.scan.client/lib</li>
<li>Configure "Interpreter - Python" to your python binary, e.g. /usr/bin/python.
    This seems to be necessary to support full PyDev source-level
    debugging, even when only planning to use Jython.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things to try:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Invoke menu CSS/Display/Scan Monitor</li>
<li>Open the examples/*.opi files</li>
<li>Open examples/custom_scan.py in the PyDev editor.</li>
<li>Use the context menu Run As, Jython... or Debug As, Jython </li>
</ul>

<h3>PyDev Jython Console</h3>

<ul>
<li>Open eclipse console view</li>
<li>From its toolbar, open new PyDev Console, selecting Jython when prompted.</li>
<li><p>A new PyDev console for Jython should appear in the Eclipse console view,
    executing the initial commands like "import sys".
    </p>
    <p>If you get an error "Failed to read servers response: Connection	refused",
    increase the "Maximum connection attempts for initial communication" setting
    mentioned in the previous section.
    </p>
</li>
<li>Type this:
<pre>
// These "Initial interpreter commands" should appear:
sys.path.append('/path/to/org.csstudio.scan/examples')
from scan_client import *

// Then try to create scans from the console
scan('Demo 1D', ('xpos', 0, 10, 0.1))

scan('Demo 2D', ('xpos', 0, 10, 0.1), ('ypos', 0, 10, -0.5))

scan.server.getScanInfos()
</pre>
</li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
