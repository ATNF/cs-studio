<h2>Welcome</h2>
You see this introduction when you start Control System Studio (CSS)
for the very first time.
On subsequent use, you can access it via the "Help" menu, subsection
"Welcome".
<br>
In case this introduction is "maximized" to fill the whole application
window, use the "Restore" button on the window border so that you can
read while also using CSS for your first steps.
When done, close it by pressing the "X" button
next to the	title.

<h2>Control System Studio</h2>
CSS is a combined effort of several parties, including
DESY (Hamburg, Germany), SNS (Oak Ridge, TN), and others.
<p>    
It provides a collection of control system tools in a common environment,
based on Eclipse Java technology.
This application is an SNS-specific collection of CSS tools.
    
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
Some basic follow-along ideas to try as a first-time user:
<h3>Probe</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click on the menu bar item "CSS", select "Diagnostic Tools", followed by
    "Probe" to open the CSS Probe tool.
<li>Enter a PV Name, for example "DTL_LLRF:IOC1:Load"
    (press 'Enter' when done typing the name).
    You should see the value of that PV.
<li>Close Probe via the 'X' in its title bar.
<li>Re-open Probe via the "CSS" menu as before.
    Note that the PV Name entry field has a drop-down box attached to it,
    which contains the last few PV names that you entered,
    so it's easy to re-inspect previously used PVs.
</ol>
In case of connection problems or error messages, the network preferences
under the menu "CSS/Preferences...", subsection "CSS Core/EPICS", might
need adjustments.

<h3>Data Browser</h3>
<ol>
<li>To start a new Data Browser instance, use the "CSS" menu
    entry "Trends/Data Browser".
<li>On the empty graph, open the context menu (right-click),
    select "Add PV", and enter a PV name.
<li>You should see a Strip-Chart of the channel's data.
	If you don't, try the "auto zoom" button
    <img src="../images/autozoom.gif" width="16" height="16"/>
    or the other buttons on top of the plot to zoom/pan.
<li>Add another PV (maybe "DTL_HPRF:IOC3:Load").
    Per default it is on its own axis.
    Compare the effects of the "Auto Zoom" and "Stagger" buttons.
<li>Use the plot's context menu to open the "Config View", which allows
    changes to the line color etc. as well as adding more PV names.
    Change the axis indices so that both PVs are on the same Y-axis.
<li>In the Config View, open the context menu of the PV list
    (right-click while the mouse if for example over the color box of a PV).
    The context menu has a "CSS" sub-entry of applications that accept PVs.
    Select "Probe".
    This should start a new instance of Probe on the selected PV.
    <br>
    Many CSS apps offer this type of shortcut: The context
    menu on a PV allows you to send that PV to another application. 
<li>Try to close the plot via the 'X' in its title bar.
    You will be asked if you want do save the current configuration to a file.
    Select "Yes", select the "CSS" folder, and enter a file name like "plot".
<li>In the "Navigator" at the left side of the window, you should
    now be able to open the "CSS" folder (click the triangle next to it)
    and find the saved Data Browser configuration file in there.
    Double-click it to open.
</ol>

<h2>Workbench</h2>
Become familiar with the general CSS workbench behavior.
<p>
The Data Browser plot, of which there could be more than one, will
stay in the center of the workbench, while you can arrange the
accessory views like the "Data Browser Config" or the "Probe"
views in various ways around the central area.
Try to move them around by dragging their title bar to a new location.
Note how the cursor shape changes to indicate how the view can be placed.
<p>
The arrangement of workbench windows is called a <em>Perspective</em>.
The initial perspective is called "SNS Control System Studio",
as indicated by a label in the upper left screen corner.
The button to the left of the current perspective allows opening other
perspectives.
Use it to open the predefined "Data Browser" perspective, might be useful
for Data Browser related work.
Switch between the two perspectives by clicking on their title tab.
A right-click on their title opens a context menu that allows you to
save the current view layout under a
different name or restore the original layout of a perspective. 

<h4>Help</h4>
Use the "Help/Help Contents" menu to open the help pages,
and read the CSS-Applications related entries.
<p>
"Help/Cheat Sheets..." contains step-by-step
instructions for selected tasks. Use the 'triangle'
in the Cheat Sheets view panel to open the drop-down
list of available sheets
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr>
  <td align=right>
    Cheat Sheets: &nbsp;
  </td>
  <td align=left>
    <img src="../images/cheat.png" width="396" height="89"/><br>
