<h2>Starting a new Data Browser</h2>
You can open a new Data Browser via the menu item
<pre>CSS/Trends/Data Browser</pre>
<p>
This will result in an empty plot window.

<h2>Data Browser Perspective</h2>
Especially for first-time users it might be
advisable to switch to the designated Data Browser
Perspective, which results in a predefined
arrangement of the plot window
as well as a common set of related views
(Archive, Config and Export Views):
Invoke the plot's context menu,
typically by "right-clicking" inside the Data Browser plot,
and select <pre>Data Browser Perspective</pre> menu item.
<p>
If your screen significantly differs from the snapshow
shown below, somebody has already customized the
Data Browser Perspective.
If you want to reset it, select the menu item
<pre>Window/Reset Perspective</pre>
