<h1>Editing Values</h1>
Edit values by clicking into the cell, entering a new value, then
pressing <b>Return</b>. The background of edited cells changes to
indicate that they differ from the original value of the PV.
Note that changes are not written out to PVs, yet,
until the changes are <a href=save_limits.html>saved.</a>

<p>

Cells in columns which have a gray background and a
<a href=tooltips.html>Tooltip</a>
that indicates <b>read-only</b> can not be edited.
See <a href=config.html>Configuration Files</a>.

<h2>Change Multiple Limits To The Same Value</h2>
To set multiple cells in a row to the same value,
select the desired rows, then right-click on 
one cell in the desired column and invoke <b>Set Value</b>
from the context menu.
<p>
In the example below, the rows for "MEBT 1" to "CCL 4"
were selected, then the right button context menu
was invoked on one of the selected cells in the
"PwrLmtAdm" column. After entering a value and pressing <b>OK</b>,
the "PwrLmtAdm" cells for rows "MEBT 1" to "CCL 4"
will be set to the entered value.
