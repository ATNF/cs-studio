<h2>WebOPI</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The dreams to bring your control system to web browser come true!
</p>
<p>
WebOPI aims to provide web access to Operator Interfaces (OPI) that 
were created in CSS BOY, the Best OPI, Yet. With WebOPI, people can 
seamlessly visit their OPIs from anywhere in the world at any time 
via a web-browser-equipped device such as a PC, laptop, tablet or 
smart phone. The WebOPI is built upon the Eclipse Rich Ajax Platform (RAP),
 which allows single sourcing between RCP and RAP. Most of the BOY widget code 
 was reused for the WebOPI. OPIs displayed in a web browser look very similar 
to the original BOY OPIs. Most of BOY OPI functions are supported in WebOPI,
 including the support of Macros, Rules, JavaScript? and Python script. Without
any additional work, you can easily deploy OPIs created in BOY on a Tomcat Web
 server by copying them to a pre-configured directory.

<h3>Install</h3>
<p>Only Tomcat Server has been tested. In principle, it can be 
deployed on all Servlet Containers that implement the Servlet API 2.3 through 3.0. 
This includes Tomcat, Jetty, Glassfish, JBoss and WebSphere. </p>
<h5>Install on Tomcat</h5>
<p>Requirement: Java 1.6 and up. Apache Tomcat 7.0.x.</p>
<p>WebOPI is a Web Archive (WAR) file deployed on <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">
Tomcat</a> server. If you do not have Tomcat server available, 
then the first step would be installing Tomcat server.</p>

<p>After Tomcat server installed, copy WebOPI WAR file (webopi.war) to
 <code>$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/</code> ($CATALINA_HOME represents the root of your Tomcat installation). </p>
 
 <h3>Configure</h3>
 <p>The preferences of WebOPI are configured in <code>$(user.dir)/css_rap.ini</code>. 
 On Tomcat, <code>$(user.dir)</code> is same as <code>$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/</code>.
 If it is running inside Eclipse, <code>$(user.dir)</code> is the installation directory of Eclipse.
 After WebOPI is properly configured, you can start Tomcat using 
 <code>$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh</code>. (You need to restart Tomcat server each time after you
 make changes to the configuration.)</p>
 
 <p>
 css_rap.ini follows the same format of plugin_customization.ini as in CSS product.  
 Below is an css_rap.ini example, you can make  corresponding modifications for your site. </p>
 
<pre class="example_code">
#EPICS configuration
org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics/auto_addr_list=false
org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics/use_pure_java=true
org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics/addr_list=127.0.0.1 192.168.1.2
org.csstudio.platform.libs.epics/max_array_bytes=160000

#WebOPI configuration
org.csstudio.opibuilder/opi_repository=C:/path/BOY Examples/
org.csstudio.opibuilder/startup_opi=main.opi
org.csstudio.opibuilder/mobile_startup_opi=mobile.opi
org.csstudio.opibuilder/color_file=color.def
org.csstudio.opibuilder/font_file=font.def
org.csstudio.opibuilder/top_opis=http://www.xxx.com/xxx/Site/main.opi
org.csstudio.opibuilder/opi_gui_refresh_cycle=200
org.csstudio.opibuilder/macros="N","North"|"W","West"|"SYS","LLRF"|"SubSys","HPM"</pre>

<p>In above example, EPICS configuration items are same as in CSS. Most items in WebOPI configuration
are same as in BOY, but there are there additional items:</p> 
<ul>
<li>opi_repository: It is a path to the directory where the OPI files are placed. It can also 
be an URL path,for example: http://mysite.com/opi_files/ </li>
<li>startup_opi: The default start up OPI when no OPI is specified in URL.</li>
<li>mobile_startup_opi (optional): The default start up OPI for mobile URL.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Except <code>opi_repository</code> which must be an absolute path to a directory, 
you can use either relative or absolute path for path items, 
such as startup_opi, color_file and top_opis. If it is relative path, 
it is relative to <code>opi_repository.</code></p>


<h3>Web Access URL</h3>
<p>If you directly put webopi.war under $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/, then the address to 
access WebOPI would be <code>http://your_site.com/webopi/</code>. or <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080/webopi/</code>.
You can also rename webopi.war to whatever name you like, such as your_name.war, then the URL would
be <code>http://your_site.com/your_name</code>.
Once after you connected to above URL, it will automatically append <code>/w</code> to the URL. 
</p>
<p>Using above URL will open the <code>startup_opi</code> specified in css_rap.ini. To open other OPIs, 
you can directly append <code>?opi=path/to/opi.opi</code> to the URL. It can be either relative 
or absolute path. For example: <br>
<code>http://your_site.com/webopi/w?opi=widgets/1_2_Image.opi</code><br>
You can also append macros to the opi file as the macros input of the opi. For example:
<br>
<code>http://your_site.com/webopi/w?opi=widgets/1_2_Image.opi|m1=hello|m2=I'm BOY</code>
<br>
Macros are separated by <code>|</code>.


</p>



<p>For mobile, you can replace <code>/w</code> with <code>/m</code> in the URL to open <code>mobile_startup_opi</code>
by default. For example: <code>http://your_site.com/webopi/m</code></p>

<p>WebOPI also support standalone mode, in which there will be no toolbar and editor tab. See
figure below. To access OPI in this mode, you simply need to replace <code>/w</code> or <code>/m</code>
with <code>/ws</code> or <code>/ms</code> in the URL. For example: <code>
http://your_site.com/webopi/ws</code></p>



<p>
<img height=300  src="img/WebOPI_StandAloneMode.gif">
</p>

<p>
It also allows to use macros in URL, for example:
<code>http://your_site.com/webopi/ws?opi=$(m)/myopi.opi</code>

The macros are defined in the preference file with the item <code>macros</code>.
</p>

<h3> Known Issues</h3>
<p> 
Here is the list of things that are not supported in WebOPI, please avoid to use these functions in your OPI if you want to deploy it on web.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Doesn't support workspace, so you cannot use absolute workspace path in WebOPI. Use relative path everywhere if possible.</li>
 <li>Doesn't support ESC key. Press ESC key will stop client side update. So you cannot cancel editing in text input widget.
  This is a bug of RAP, see <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/mv/msg/33802/109693/#msg_109693">http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/mv/msg/33802/109693/#msg_109693</a>
  </li>  
  

 <li>No ramp on Gauge, Meter and Knob. Reason: Arc is filled in chord in RAP. See 
 <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=353421">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=353421</a></li>
 <li>Does't support dash line</li>
 <li>Doesn't support Pattern (3D effect)</li>
 <li>The fill level property of  Ellipse, Polygon don't work.</li>
 <li>Tooltip is not supported</li>
 <li>Animation GIF is not well supported</li>
 <li>No Console</li>
 <li>No File Dialog.</li>
 <li>On Firefox 3.6.x, the right click target will stick on the first clicked target.</li>
 <li>Can only play wave file from an URL.</li>
  <li>Cannot hide part of a widget in container.</li>
 <li>Mouse drag event will not be automatically released if a dialog popped up during dragging.
 This will cause mouse dragging behavior on Knob, Scaled Slider widgets doesn't work as expected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trouble Shooting</h3>
<h5>Tomcat cannot be accessed after restart</h5>
<p>Using shutdown.sh cannot fully shutdown tomcat sometimes, so you have to kill tomcat manually and
 then start tomcat again. The command to find tomcat's pid is <code>ps aux|grep tomcat</code></p>
