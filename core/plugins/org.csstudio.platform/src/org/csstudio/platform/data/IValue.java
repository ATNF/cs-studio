/** Base interface for all control system values.
 *  <p>
 *  The <code>Value</code> handles all the other 'stuff' that comes with
 *  a control system value except for the actual value itself:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Time stamp
 *  <li>A severity code that indicates if the data reflects some sort of warning
 *      or error state.
 *  <li>A status string that explains the severity.
 *  <li>Meta data that might be useful for displaying the data.
 *  </ul>
 *  
 *  It also offers convenience routines for displaying values.
 *  <p>
 *  In some cases, that's already all that there might be, because
 *  a sample can have a severity that indicates that there was no value,
 *  and the status describes why.
 *  <p>
 *  In most cases, however, access to the actual data requires the specific
 *  subtypes <code>DoubleValue</code>, <code>StringValue</code> etc.

     *  an 'averaged' sample. For those processed values, the time stamp
     *  actually no longer matches one specific instance in time when the
     *  front-end controller obtained a sample.
     *  <p>
     *  While the quality code does not fully describe what happened to the
     *  data, it provides a hint to for example a plotting tool, so that
     *  processed samples can be shown in a different way from original
     *  samples.
