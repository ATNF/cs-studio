API for accessing archived data.
<p>
ArchiveServer is the base for getting at actual data.
Plugins that provide an ArchiveServer should do this
by implementing the ArchiveImplementation extension point.
<p>
Client code that wants to access archived data should
use the ArchiveImplementationRegistry to obtain an ArchiveServer
based on a URL.
