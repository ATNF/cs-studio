<h1>Data Browser</h1>

This is not done!
It is in the early design stages, only some basic tests work.
<p>
To try:
<ul>
<li>Run the 'excas' from EPICS base
<li>Run org.csstudio.trends.databrowser.SWTTest as an SWT application.
<li>... or try to load this as a plugin and open the "DataBrowser" View.
</ul>
