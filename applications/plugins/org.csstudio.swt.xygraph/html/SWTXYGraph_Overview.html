	<h2>SWT XYGraph Overview</h2>
	<p>
	SWT XYGraph is an xy graph component based on 
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">Draw2D</a>, 
	which could be used not only in any SWT applications, 
	but also has the ability to be integrated in any <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">GEF</a> based applications.
	</p>
	<p>
	SWT XYGraph has most of the functionalities for an xy graph, 
	plot or chart in the field of science and engineering:

	<h4>Based on SWT/Draw2D</h4>
	<p>
		SWT XYGraph is based on <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">Draw2D</a>, 
		if you implement Eclipse plug-ins, SWT-based standalone applications or 
		<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gef/">GEF</a> based projects, 
		SWT XYGraph would be the best candidate for your plot or chart functionality requirements.
