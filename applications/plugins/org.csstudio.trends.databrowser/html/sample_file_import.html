<h2>Data Browser Sample File Import</h2>
With the Sample File Import you can display samples from an external 
file in the Data Browser. For large number of samples (>100.000) there 
might be a delay for zoom, shift, … in the graph, because the Data Browser 
is designed to get data from an archive server. The Import action is 
available. The Sample File Import is not available in all CSS versions.

The Sample File Import action is available from the context menu (right click)
in the
<a href=config_view.html>Config View</a>.

<h4>CSV Files</h4>
In the File Browser you can select the sample file for import. 
To distinguish between the different formats generated by the scopes the Sample 
File Import uses the file extension *.cvs-&ltscope-id&gt. The currently supported formats are:

<h3>Import Settings</h3>
After selecting the sample file the next dialog shows the channels in the file 
with the available information.
<p>
<h4>Choose the records to display</h4>

<p>
In this section is the list of all channels in the file with the name, start/end time of the 
measurement, number of samples that will be imported, total number of samples in the file, unit of 
the channel, formula to recalculate the samples. The fields name and unit are editable that you can 
change them for the import. The checkbox at the beginning of the row marks the channels that 
should be imported.
<p>
<h4>Time range for graph</h4>
<img src=file_import_time_range.png/>
<p>
The Start/End field shows the currently selected start and end time. If there is no 
active databrowser editor the default time is read from the sample file. If there is 
an active editor the default time is read from the time range in the graph. With the 
button 'Time' you can set the start/end time manually. The button 'from Graph' read 
the time range from the active editor and the button 'From File' from the sample file.
The number of samples in the previous section will be automatically updated.
<p>
<h4>Factor</h4>
<img src=file_import_factor.png/>
<p>
Especially for large files it is important to reduce the number of samples. For 
more than 100.000 samples the performance of the databrowser is slow. The Sample import 
will read each &ltfactor&gt sample.
<p>
<h4>Time offset</h4>

<p>
Add a time offset to the time in the file. If you want to import channels from different 
scopes with asynchronous clocks you can adjust the file time to synchronise the samples.
