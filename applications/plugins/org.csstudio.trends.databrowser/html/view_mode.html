<h2>Data Browser View Mode</h2>
When launching the Data Browser via the CSS Menu,
from the context menu of a PV,
or by opening an existing Data Browser configuration file,
it runs in <b>edit</b> mode.
<br>
As the name implies, this mode allows you to edit,
i.e. change the Data Browser configuration by
adding PVs via Drag-and-Drop, by opening the
associated
<a href=config_view.html>Config View</a>
and
<a href=archive_view.html>Archive View</a>.

<p>
Alternatively, one can use the context menu of a
Data Browser config file or of selected PVs to open
a Data Browser instance in <b>view</b> mode.
<br>
This is a read-only mode with limited functionality.
Only changes supported by the 
<a href=plot_window.html#ButtonBar>Button Bar</a>
of the plot window are accessible,
and even that Button bar is initially
hidden, and needs to be opened via the context menu
of the view mode window.
<br>
The only advantage:
View windows offer some added positioning options,
including a "detached" mode.
