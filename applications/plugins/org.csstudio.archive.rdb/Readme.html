<h1>Archive RDB</h1>

Routines for reading and writing archived data
from the relational database.

<ul>
<li>See dbd directory for MySQL demo setup.
<li>When used with Oracle, the "schema" preference setting is used,
    and a special "jdbc:oracle_stage:" URL is allowed,
    see RDBArchive.connect()
</ul>

The Archive engine will directly use this API to write.
<P>
The org.csstudio.archive.rdbclient Plug-In uses this API
to implement the archive client API that the Data Browser
then uses to read samples.
