<h1>JMS Monitor</h1>

The JMS Monitor is a utility for monitoring raw JMS messages.
It is a debug tool for developers.
<ul>
<li>After entering a JMS "Topic" like "LOG", "ALARM", "TALK" etc.,
    it will display received messages.
<li>Message detail for selected row is available via 
    Properties View.
<li>The application is currently limited to "Map" messages.
</ul>
The JMS server URL is configured via Eclipse preferences:
Initial defaults are in file preferences.ini of the JMS Monitor plugin;
the application's plugin_customization.ini can override.
