<h2>Starting a new, empty Data Browser</h2>
You can open a new Data Browser via the menu item
<pre>CSS/Trends/Data Browser</pre>
<p>
This will result in an empty plot window
to which one can then <a href=add_pvs.html>add PVs</a>.
You can open more than one Data Browser instance.

<h2>Data Browser Perspective</h2>
Especially for first-time users it might be
advisable to switch to the designated Data Browser
Perspective, which results in a predefined
arrangement of the plot window
as well as a common set of related views
(Navigator, Config, Archive, and Export):
<br>
Invoke the plot's context menu,
typically by "right-clicking" inside the Data Browser plot,
and select the <pre>Data Browser Perspective</pre> menu item.
<p>
If your screen differs significantly from the snapshow
shown below, somebody has already customized the
Data Browser Perspective.
If you want to reset it, select the context menu of the
perspective (right click on the "Data Browser" tab)
and select "Reset".

<h2>Stopping a Data Browser Instance</h2>
You can simply close a Data Browser Plot window via the usual
icon in the window title bar or the context menu of the window
title bar.
<p>
If the Data Browser configuration has not been saved,
either because it was never saved,
or because a saved confguration has been modified,
you will be prompted with a dialog that asks you
to either save the configuration or close without
saving it.

<h2>The Workspace, "Project" Folders</h2>
All configuration files are saved in "Project" folders in the "Workspace".
The CSS Application will create an initial "CSS" project folder for you.
To create additional ones to better organize your files:
<ol>
<li>Unless it is already open, obtain a "Workspace Explorer" view,
    accessible via the Menu
   <pre>Window/Show View.../Other.../Other/Workspace Explorer</pre>
<li>Each top-level folder in that view is a "Project" in your
    "Workspace".
    Create new projects via the Workspace Explorer context menu
    <pre>New Project</pre>
    In the resulting "New Project" dialog, enter a project name.
</ol>

<h2>Saving Data Browser Configurations</h2>
All configuration files are stored in "Project" folders,
see previous section.

In order to save files, one can use the "File/Save As.." menu.
If the configuration has already been saved, the Plot window title
bar will show the current configuration file name,
and a "File/Save" menu allows saving changes to the current file name.

<h2>Re-loading a Data Browser Configurations</h2>
You open a saved Data Browser configuration by double-clicking on the
configuration file in the "Workspace Explorer".

<h2>Creating a new, empty Data Browser Configurations</h2>
You can of course open a new Data Browser Plot window and then
use "File/Save As" to save its configuration as shown above.
<p>
Alternatively, you can directly create a new, empty Data Browser
configuration file like this:
<ul>
<li>Open the "Workspace Explorer" view.
<li>Invoke its "New Data Browser" context menu.
<li>In the resulting dialog, select the Project folder
    as well as the configuration file name.
</ul>
