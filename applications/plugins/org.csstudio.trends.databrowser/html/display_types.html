<h2>Data Display Types</h2>

The <a href=config_view.html>Config View</a> allows the selection
of various "Display Types" for the data.

<h3>Area</h3>
This mode displays the numeric values of a PV with a staircase line.
<br>
If additional minimum/maximum information is available for the samples,
that min/max envelope is indicated by a shaded area.

<p>
Min/max info is typically obtained by using the "optimized" request type
and having a sufficiently large time range. See <a href=request_types.html>Request Types</a>.
<p>
Boxes on the time axis indicate samples that have no numeric value.
By clicking on them, you add a Marker which will indicate if
the PV was for example "Disconnected", as shown in the next image.
There may be similar boxes on other samples, where again a marker will
provide the detail.

<h3>Lines</h3>
This mode displays the numeric values of a PV with a staircase line.
<br>
If additional minimum/maximum information is available for the samples,
that min/max envelope is indicated by a additional lines.
If there is no min/max information because we are already looking
at the 'raw' data, this is the same as the "Single Line" mode described next.

<h3>Single Line</h3>
This mode displays the numeric values of a PV with a staircase line.
It does <b>not</b> display additional minimum/maximum information,
and should be avoided because you might miss excursions in the actual
data by only viewing the averages.

<h3>Markers</h3>
This mode displays the numeric values of a PV with a marker.
Min/max info is displayed by lines.

<h3>Bars</h3>
This mode displays the numeric values of a PV with bars that always
start at the time axis.
It does <b>not</b> display additional minimum/maximum information,
and will only be useful in very few cases.
