<h2>Data Browser Config View</h2>
Most of the configuration is adjusted in this view,
accessible via the context menu of the plot window.
<br>
It has two sub-sections or "tabs".

<h3>Process Variables</h3>
This subsection configures which PVs are shown.
One can add PVs by entering their name in the
"<Add PV" cell of the Process Variable table,
delete PVs via the context menu of the same table,
change their color, line width and axis type
(linear, log. scale).
<p>
One can also change the axis assignments by
modifying the "Axis" index, which identifies
the Y-Axes via numbers 0, 1, 2, ...
<p>
One can drop archive data sources from the
<a href=archive_view.html>Archive View</a>
onto a PV, and rearrange the order of 
archives for a PV via the context menu
of the "Archives used for ..." table.

<h3>Live Data Config</h3>
This subsection configures how often 'live'
data samples are taken for the PVs,
and how often the plot redraws.
