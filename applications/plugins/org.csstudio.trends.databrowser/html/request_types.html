<h2>Data Request Types</h2>

The <a href=config_view.html>Config View</a> allows the selection
of "Request Types" for archived data.
<p>
Note that these options only affect how history data is retrieved
from the archive. It cannot influence how data has been or will
be added to the archive. Some PVs update at 10Hz and are archived
once a minute. Others might update when changed via an operator
screen, and are archived for every change. How a PV updates is
determined by the front-end device that provides the PV.
How it is archived depends on the archive sampling engine.
The Data Browser only displays the live and archived data.


<h3>Optimized Request</h3>
This is the default.
The optimized request type automatically switches between original samples
and min/max/average information.
Under CSS/Preferences/../Trends/DataBrowser, you can configure the number
of "bins" used for data retrieval. Assume we configure 500 "bins", and
the graph has a one-day time range.
If there are less than 500 samples in the archive, you will get those 500
original samples. If there are more, you will get the average sample combined
with the minimum and maximum for each "bin".
<p>
When "zooming in", the Data Browser will request samples for the new time
range, which might reveal more detail and ultimately switch to "original"
samples.
<p>
The optimized request type therefore tries to minimize the amount of
data that needs to be transferred over the network and handled in the plot,
while still providing enough information to see how the PV data behaved.


<h3>Raw Request</h3>
In rare cases, limitations in the optimized request mechanism need to be overcome
by enforcing 'raw' data retrieval. In most cases, however,
requesting 'raw' data will not provide
any new information but only cause your computer to run out of memory.
<p>
If you need the raw data for an extended time range for post-processing,
you should use the <a href=export_view.html>Export View</a>.
