      Widget Properties
    </h2>
    <p>
      The outlooking, behavior, location and size of widgets are called properties. The properties could be set in
      property sheet in editing mode, and also can be changed in the attached scripts during running. The value of the
      any property can be accessed with Property Macro by property_id.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases, the property_id is following this convention corresponding to the property name:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
      lower case of all characters
    </li>
    <li>
    eplace space to underscore.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  For Example: The property_id of "Foreground Color" is "foreground_color".
