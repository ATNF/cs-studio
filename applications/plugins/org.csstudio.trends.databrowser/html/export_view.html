<h2>Data Browser Export View</h2>
This view allows export of samples from the current plot
to files for further analysis.
You can open it via the context menu of the
<a href=plot_window.html>plot window</a>.

<ul>
<li>Start/End Time:<br>
    You can use the start and time time of the current plot,
    i.e. use the X-Axis range of that plot,
    or manually select times.
    You can either enter them in the YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS format for year, month,
    day, hour, minute seconds, or use the 
    "Select" button to open a calendar-type dialog.
<li>Source:<br>
    You can export data from the current plot as it is currently kept in the
    Data Browser memory. This will include the 'live' samples which might not
    yet be in the archive. On the downside, the 'historic' data will be
    exported as shown in the plot, which is usually data that has been
    reduced for plotting purposes, and not the full-detailed archived data.
    <p>
    To export the original archive data, select "Raw Archive".
    Alternatively, you can also export data from the archive that has been
    averaged to the provided time interval. "00:01:00" as shown in the
    screenshot means: One averaged sample every minute (HH:MM:SS format).
<li>Output:<br>
    You typically want to export data in a spreadsheet-type format,
    including a column for additional severity/status information.
    In the spreadsheet, samples that did not receive a 'new' value, yet,
    will repeat their previous values in following rows in order to allow
    spreadsheet-type operations.
    Alternatively, you can export the PVs one by one into the file by
    not selecting the spreadsheet output, and you can also omit the severity/
    status column.
<li>Format:<br>
    The default format uses information that might have come with the
    PV from the control system. Alternatively, you can force "decimal"
    or "exponential" notation with a specific number of fractional digits.
<li>Filename:<br>
    Enter the filename into which the exported data is to be written,
    or "Browse" to get a file name dialog.
</ul>
Finally, the "Export" button starts the actual export.
