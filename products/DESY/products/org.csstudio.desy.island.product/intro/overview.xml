				  CSS is a collection of control system tools.
				  This version of CSS helps to get you started.
				  Without (at least with minimal) configuration you can connect to an EPICS-based control system.
				  By clicking the above link you open the help pages, which give you an introduction into the use of
				  CSS itself (managing views and the like) as well as providing examples of how to use the tools.
				  Please take a look at the first steps page too. You will get introductions to the most important tools from there.
				  Have fun!
