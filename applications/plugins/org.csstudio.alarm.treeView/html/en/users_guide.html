<h1>Alarm Tree User's Guide</h1>
<p>This is the user's guide for the alarm tree.</p>
<h2>Preferences</h2>
<p>The preference page for the alarm tree is <i>CSS Applications &gt; Alarm
&gt; Alarm Tree</i>.</p>
<p>First, make sure that the LDAP directory server and the JMS servers are set
up correctly. The alarm tree will listen to two JMS servers for redundancy.
Chaning the JMS settings after the tree is already running requires a
restart.</p>
<p>After the servers are set up, you can use the <i>Facility names</i> list to
add the facilities that you would like to display in the tree. You can select
any number of facilities. You can change the LDAP settings and facility
selection even when the tree is already running. Simply click the
&quot;Reload&quot; button in the tree's toolbar after saving the new
preferences. The alarm tree will use the new setting when reloading the
tree.</p>

<h2>Using the view</h2>
<h3>Icons</h3>
<p>The view displays each node with two vertical, colored rectangles as the
node's icon. The left part of the icon indicates the node's highest
unacknowledged alarm, the right part indicates the current alarm state. The
colors represent the following severities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red: major</li>
<li>Yellow: minor</li>
<li>Blue: invalid</li>
<li>Green: no alarm</li>
</ul>
<p>For the leaf nodes which represent individual records (process variables),
the icon indicates the alarm state of that record. For nodes which have child
nodes, the icon indicates the highest severity of its children.</p>
<h3>Acknowledging alarms</h3>
<p>When a node has any unacknowledged alarms, as indicated by a color other
than green for the left part of the icon, you can use the context menu of the
node to send an acknowledgement message for that node. Note that the node will
not be displayed as acknowledged immediately. The tree will update the node's
state when it receives the acknowledgement message.</p>
<p>When the selected node is a parent node, one acknowledgement message will be
sent for each child that has an unacknowledged alarm.</p>
<h3>Opening the alarm display</h3>
<p>If an alarm display is configured for a record in the LDAP directory, you
can open that alarm display from the context menu using the &quot;Run alarm
display&quot; action. Note that this menu item appears only if a single leaf
node (process variable node) is selected. It is not available for parent nodes
or multi selections. If the menu item appears grayed out, no alarm display is
configured for that process variable, or the attribute value does not look like
a valid CSS display file name (the value must end with .css-sds).</p>
