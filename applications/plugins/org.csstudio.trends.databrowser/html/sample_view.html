<h2>Data Browser Sample View</h2>
This view allows you to select one of the PVs
in the active plot and see all its samples
in tabular form.
<p>
<img src=samples.png width=418 height=219/>
<p>
This might be useful in cases where you need the exact numerical
values and time stamps of a PV.
While the 'Marker' facility of the
<a href=plot_window.html>Plot Window</a>
can provide this information for a few samples on the plot,
a tabular view is sometimes more useful.
<p>
You can also use the <a href=export_view.html>Export View</a>
to save such a list of samples to a file.
<p>
Note that the Sample View will <u>not</u> automatically refresh whenever
new samples arrive from an ongoing archive request or as 'live' data from
the control system, because the necessary table redraws would be too
costly. Instead, you need to manually trigger a refresh via the corresponding
"Refresh" button.
